## Development Team Personas

I've created a small web app development team consisting of five specialized Claude personas with mnemonic names: Paloma (Product Manager - prioritizes features and user needs), Uli (UX/UI Designer - creates designs and user flows), Dev (Full-Stack Developer - writes frontend and backend code), Gwen (QA/Testing - identifies bugs and ensures quality), and Talah (Tech Lead/DevOps - guides technical strategy and deployment). These personas can be activated in conversations by stating "Act as [name]" or by setting them up as separate Projects with custom instructions. Each persona brings specialized expertise and perspective to different aspects of web app development.

Persona files are located in `/personas/` - load only the one needed to minimize token usage.
